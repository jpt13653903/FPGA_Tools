# FPGA Bootcamp

This folder contains the complete projects taken from the 2014 FPGA Bootcamp 
presented at Wits.

The idea is to eventually strip out the useful and generic modules and put 
them in the root folder of the repo.  Some useful modules include:

- SD-Card reader with pre-fetch cache (better implemented than the root folder version)
- VGA display with classic DOS-style text abstraction
